I do random projects on my github. Maybe someday I'll have some huge open source project on here,
but right now it is a graveyard of unfinished projects and broken dreams.
Just kidding, some of them ARE finished and they are written in a large variety of languages.
My goal for this is to come back and do some of the dead projects like the lexer/OS webpage later when I have more experience.
Maybe I'll update this page again someday. 
Or not. 
Who knows?
