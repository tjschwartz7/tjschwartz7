I do random projects on my github. Everything I do that I think is at least somewhat interesting gets posted here. 
My goal for this is to come back and do some of the dead projects like the lexer/OS webpage later when I have more experience. In the meantime, I will continue to work on projects which interest me, and continue to gain knowledge and experience.
